  <h2> About </h2>
    <p> I am a photographer based in New York City currently working towards a BFA in Photography at Parsons School of Design
      and a BA in journalism at Eugene Lang College of Liberal Arts. </p>
    <p>  My work focuses in documentary, most recently navigating and exploring family dynamics through an observatory and sometimes diaristic lens. </p>
